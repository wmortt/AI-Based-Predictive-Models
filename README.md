# AI-Based-Predictive-Models
This repository showcases my work from a university coursework project in the Big Data Engineering and Analytics course. The task was to select a dataset and identify a relevant machine learning problem, then implement the necessary methods for solving it. I chose a weather dataset and developed predictive models to forecast extreme weather events like heatwaves and heavy precipitation. In addition, I applied generative AI techniques to generate synthetic weather data, improving the accuracy of the models. To handle large datasets, I used Dask for parallel processing, significantly optimizing computation time. The repository includes complete code, data processing workflows, and visualizations to demonstrate the techniques used and the results obtained.
